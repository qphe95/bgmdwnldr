Check mbedtls_calloc overallocation
# This test case exercises an integer overflow in calloc. Under sanitizers, with
# a modern Clang, this triggers a complaint. The complaint
# can be avoided with sanitizer-specific environment options,
# but this has to be set in the environment before the program starts,
# and could hide other errors.
